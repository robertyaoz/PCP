# Posterior Conformal Prediction (PCP)

This repository contains the Python code to implement the method PCP in our article [Posterior Conformal Prediction](https://candes.su.domains/publications/).

To generate PCP intervals with approximate conditional coverage, we follow our synthetic data as an example


```python





```

To reproduce the experiments and figures in our articles, please download the following datasets and run the corresponding notebooks.
